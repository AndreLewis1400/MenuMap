## 🎯 **What We've Accomplished So Far**

### ✅ **Completed Tasks**

1. **📁 Project Structure Created**
   - Organized deliverable 2 folder structure
   - Created separate directories for Architecture, UML_Diagrams, Design_Patterns, and Documentation

2. **🏗️ Architectural Patterns Selected**
   - **Primary**: Layered Architecture (separation of concerns, maintainability)
   - **Secondary**: Model-View-Controller (UI separation, reusability)

3. **📦 Package Diagram Designed**
   - 7 major subsystems identified
   - Clear package dependencies defined
   - Use case mapping to subsystems completed

4. **🎯 7 Use Cases Identified**
   - UC-001: Browse Restaurant Menus
   - UC-002: Manage Favorites
   - UC-003: Secure Password Reset
   - UC-004: User Registration & Login
   - UC-005: Menu Verification System
   - UC-006: Spam Protection System
   - UC-007: Restaurant Owner Menu Management

5. **🎨 Design Patterns Documented**
   - **Observer Pattern**: Real-time updates and notifications
   - **Factory Pattern**: Object creation without specifying classes
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Interchangeable algorithms

6. **📊 Minimal Class Diagram Created**
   - All system classes identified
   - Class relationships defined
   - Design pattern integration documented

7. **🔄 State Machine Diagram Designed**
   - Overall system states defined
   - State transitions documented
   - User journey mapped

## 🚀 **Next Steps (Ready to Continue)**

### **Immediate Next Tasks:**

1. **📊 Create Detailed Class Diagram**
   - Add attributes and methods to all classes
   - Show design pattern implementations
   - Document OCL statements for control objects

2. **🔄 Create 7 Sequence Diagrams**
   - One for each use case
   - Show object interactions
   - Include solution objects

3. **📱 Set Up Papyrus Project**
   - Create UML diagrams in Papyrus
   - Export diagrams for document inclusion
   - Ensure professional formatting

4. **📝 Complete Design Document**
   - Write all required sections
   - Include meeting diary
   - Prepare for team review
