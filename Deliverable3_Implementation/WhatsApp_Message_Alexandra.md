## Test Case Coordination - Chapter 7

## 📱 Message Option 1: Brief & Direct

```
Hi Alexandra! 👋

As Group Lead for Deliverable 3, I've completed my test case assignments:
✅ UC-005 (Login): 10 test cases
✅ UC-001 (Browse Menus): 8 test cases

I've created a test case assignment document in the repo that shows:
- Your assignments: UC-002 (Favorites) and UC-006 (Logout) - 6 test cases total
- Kamal's assignments: UC-003 (Password Reset) and UC-005 (Registration) - 6 test cases
- Alfonso's assignment: UC-007 (Menu Management) - 3 test cases

Since you're primary for Chapter 7, can you coordinate collecting everyone's test cases and compiling them into Chapter 7.1.3?

The format is in MenuMap_Test_Cases_Login_UC001.md - everyone should follow that format.

Let me know if you need anything! Thanks! 🙏

## 📱 Message Option 2: Detailed & Professional

```
Hi Alexandra,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about Chapter 7 (Testing Process) for Deliverable 3.

I've completed my test case assignments as Group Lead:
- UC-005 (User Login): 10 test cases (2 sunny day, 8 rainy day)
- UC-001 (Browse Restaurant Menus): 8 test cases (2 sunny day, 6 rainy day)

I've created a Test_Case_Assignments.md document in Deliverable3_Implementation that outlines:
- All team member assignments
- Required test cases per person (minimum 3 each: 2 sunny, 1 rainy)
- Test case format requirements (SystemTest-XXX-UCXXX)
- File organization structure

Your assignments:
- UC-002: Manage Favorites (3 test cases)
- UC-006: User Logout (3 test cases)

Since you're the primary owner for Chapter 7, could you:
1. Coordinate with team members to ensure they complete their test cases?
2. Collect all test case files from everyone?
3. Compile them into Chapter 7.1.3 of the Final Document?

I've included a reference file (MenuMap_Test_Cases_Login_UC001.md) that shows the exact format everyone should follow, including database state tables.

Let me know if you have any questions or need support! I'm here to help.

Thanks,
Andre
