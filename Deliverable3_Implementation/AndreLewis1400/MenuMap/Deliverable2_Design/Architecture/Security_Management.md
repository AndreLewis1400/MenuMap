## Security Management Overview

This document defines the comprehensive security architecture for the MenuMap application, covering authentication, authorization, data protection, threat mitigation, and compliance requirements. The security framework follows defense-in-depth principles with multiple layers of protection.

---

## Security Architecture Principles

### **Core Security Principles**
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers and controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access rights
3. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
4. **Fail Secure**: System fails to secure state
5. **Security by Design**: Security integrated from inception
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response

### **Security Framework**
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
- **OWASP Top 10** protection and mitigation
- **ISO 27001** security management standards
- **GDPR/CCPA** privacy compliance requirements
