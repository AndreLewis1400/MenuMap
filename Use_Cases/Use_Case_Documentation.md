- **A6.3**: User must wait before requesting another reset
- **A6.4**: Use case ends with rate limit notification

### Security Measures (Misuse Case Prevention)

#### Fraud Prevention
- **Email Verification**: Reset links only work with registered email addresses
- **Token Security**: Reset tokens are cryptographically secure and time-limited
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks on password reset
- **Account Lockout**: Suspicious activity triggers temporary account lockout

#### Abuse Prevention
- **No Email Enumeration**: System doesn't reveal if email exists in database
