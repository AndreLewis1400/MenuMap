# MenuMap Deliverable 2 - Design Phase
## CEN4010 Software Engineering - Team 9

**Software Architecture & Design Lead:** Andre Lewis  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Status:** In Progress  

---

## **What We've Accomplished So Far**

### **Completed Tasks**

1. **Project Structure Created**
   - Organized deliverable 2 folder structure
   - Created separate directories for Architecture, UML_Diagrams, Design_Patterns, and Documentation

2. **Architectural Patterns Selected**
   - **Primary**: Layered Architecture (separation of concerns, maintainability)
   - **Secondary**: Model-View-Controller (UI separation, reusability)

3. **Package Diagram Designed**
   - 7 major subsystems identified
   - Clear package dependencies defined
   - Use case mapping to subsystems completed

4. **7 Use Cases Identified**
   - UC-001: Browse Restaurant Menus
   - UC-002: Manage Favorites
   - UC-003: Secure Password Reset
   - UC-004: User Registration & Login
   - UC-005: Menu Verification System
   - UC-006: Spam Protection System
   - UC-007: Restaurant Owner Menu Management

5. **Design Patterns Documented**
   - **Observer Pattern**: Real-time updates and notifications
   - **Factory Pattern**: Object creation without specifying classes
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Interchangeable algorithms

6. **Minimal Class Diagram Created**
   - All system classes identified
   - Class relationships defined
   - Design pattern integration documented

7. **State Machine Diagram Designed**
   - Overall system states defined
   - State transitions documented
   - User journey mapped

## **Next Steps (Ready to Continue)**

### **Immediate Next Tasks:**

1. **Create Detailed Class Diagram**
   - Add attributes and methods to all classes
   - Show design pattern implementations
   - Document OCL statements for control objects

2. **Create 7 Sequence Diagrams**
   - One for each use case
   - Show object interactions
   - Include solution objects

3. **Set Up Papyrus Project**
   - Create UML diagrams in Papyrus
   - Export diagrams for document inclusion
   - Ensure professional formatting

4. **Complete Design Document**
   - Write all required sections
   - Include meeting diary
   - Prepare for team review
