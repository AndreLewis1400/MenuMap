# Papyrus Workspace Files for Alfonso (Modeler)
## Section 3.3: Object Interaction - Sequence Diagrams

---

## **Required Papyrus Workspace Files**

Alfonso needs these **5 core files** to open and edit the sequence diagrams in Papyrus:

### **Essential Files (Must Have All 5):**

1. **`MenuMap_UML_Design.aird`** **PRIMARY FILE - Open this in Papyrus**
 - This is the main representation file - Alfonso should open this file in Papyrus
 - Contains references to all diagrams including the 7 sequence diagrams

2. **`MenuMap_UML_Design.uml`**
 - Contains the actual UML model with all Interaction elements (sequence diagrams)
 - This is where the sequence diagram data is stored

3. **`MenuMap_UML_Design.di`**
 - Contains diagram layout and positioning information
 - Needed for proper diagram display

4. **`MenuMap_UML_Design.notation`**
 - Contains notation and styling information
 - Needed for diagram appearance

5. **`MenuMap_UML_Design_en_US.properties`**
 - Localization properties file
 - May be needed for proper display

---

## **File Location**

All files are located in:
```
C:\Users\alewi\workspace-papyrus\MenuMap_UML_Design\
```

---

## **7 Sequence Diagrams in the Workspace**

The following sequence diagrams are already created in the Papyrus workspace:

1. **UC-001: Browse Restaurant Menus** (Interaction_Interaction4_)
2. **UC-002: Manage Favorites** (Interaction_Interaction4_)
3. **UC-003: Secure Password Reset** (Interaction_Interaction1_)
4. **UC-004: Registration** (Interaction_Interaction1_)
5. **UC-005: User Login** (Interaction_Interaction1_)
6. **UC-006: User Logout** (Interaction_Interaction1_)
7. **UC-007: Menu Management** (Interaction_Interaction1_)

## **Instructions for Alfonso**

### **To Open the Workspace:**
1. Open Papyrus
2. File → Open Model → Navigate to `MenuMap_UML_Design.aird`
3. The workspace will load with all diagrams

### **To Find Sequence Diagrams:**
1. In Model Explorer, look for "Interaction" elements
2. The 7 sequence diagrams are stored as Interaction elements
3. Double-click any Interaction to open its sequence diagram editor

### **What Alfonso Needs to Do for Section 3.3:**
- Refine the existing sequence diagrams from SRD
- Add additional "solution objects" (if needed)
- Ensure all 7 sequence diagrams are complete
- Export updated PNG files if changes are made
- Write the text description for Section 3.3 explaining:
 - How the sequence diagrams refine the SRD diagrams
 - What solution objects were added
 - The interaction flow for each use case

## **Files to Share with Alfonso**

**Option 1: Share the entire folder**
- Share the entire `MenuMap_UML_Design` folder
- Alfonso can copy it to his Papyrus workspace location

**Option 2: Share only essential files**
- Share these 5 files:
 - MenuMap_UML_Design.aird
 - MenuMap_UML_Design.uml
 - MenuMap_UML_Design.di
 - MenuMap_UML_Design.notation
 - MenuMap_UML_Design_en_US.properties

**Option 3: Create a zip file**
- Zip all 5 essential files together
- Alfonso can extract and place in his Papyrus workspace

---

## **Important Notes**

1. **All 5 files must be kept together** - They are interdependent
2. **The .aird file is the entry point** - This is what Alfonso opens in Papyrus
3. **PNG exports are separate** - The PNG files are just exports, not the editable source
4. **Papyrus workspace location** - Alfonso may need to adjust the workspace path in Papyrus preferences

---

## **Reference Documentation**

Alfonso can also reference the sequence diagram markdown files in:
```
C:\Users\alewi\OneDrive\Desktop\MenuMap_CEN4010\Deliverable2_Design\UML_Diagrams\
```
These contain detailed descriptions of each sequence diagram's message flow.
