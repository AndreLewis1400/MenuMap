# Files for Alfonso - Sections 3.2 and 3.3
## Modeler Responsibilities

---

## **Section 3.2: State Machine (4 points)**

### **Required:**
- One state machine diagram for the overall system
- Based on the application's menu system

### **Files Provided:**
- `State_Machine_UserAuthentication_StateMachine_MM_State_Machine_Dia.PNG` - State machine diagram

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. Review the state machine diagram
2. Write a text description for Section 3.2 explaining:
 - The states in the system
 - The transitions between states
 - How the state machine represents the overall system behavior
 - How it relates to the application's menu system

---

## **Section 3.3: Object Interaction (4 points)**

### **Required:**
- Refinement of sequence diagrams from SRD
- Redo sequence diagrams from analysis model
- Add additional "solution objects" if needed
- **7 Sequence Diagrams required**

### **Files Provided:**

#### **Sequence Diagram PNG Files (7 diagrams):**
1. `UC-001-Browse_Restaurant_Menus_Sequence.PNG`
2. `UC-002-Manage_Favorites_Sequence.PNG`
3. `UC-003-Secure_Password_Reset_Sequence.PNG`
4. `UC-004-Registration_Sequence.PNG`
5. `UC-005-User_Login.PNG`
6. `UC-006-User_Logout_Sequence.PNG`
7. `UC-007-Menu_Management_Sequence.PNG`

#### **Sequence Diagram Documentation (7 markdown files):**
- `UC-001-Browse_Restaurant_Menus_Sequence.md`
- `UC-002-Manage_Favorites_Sequence.md`
- `UC-003-Secure_Password_Reset_Sequence.md`
- `UC-004-User_Login_Sequence.md`
- `UC-005-User_Registration_Sequence.md`
- `UC-006-User_Logout_Sequence.md`
- `UC-007-Restaurant_Owner_Menu_Management_Sequence.md`

#### **Papyrus Workspace Instructions:**
- `PAPYRUS_FILES_FOR_ALFONSO.md` - Instructions for accessing and editing the Papyrus workspace files

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. Review all 7 sequence diagrams
2. Refine the sequence diagrams from the SRD (if needed)
3. Add any additional "solution objects" that may be required
4. Write a text description for Section 3.3 explaining:
 - How the sequence diagrams refine the SRD diagrams
 - What solution objects were added (if any)
 - The interaction flow for each use case
 - How the sequence diagrams represent object interactions

---

## **Summary**

**Section 3.2 (State Machine):**
- State machine diagram provided
- Write text description explaining the state machine

**Section 3.3 (Object Interaction):**
- All 7 sequence diagram PNGs provided
- All 7 sequence diagram documentation files provided
- Papyrus workspace instructions provided
- Review and refine sequence diagrams if needed
- Write text description explaining the sequence diagrams

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Review the state machine diagram for Section 3.2
2. Review all 7 sequence diagrams for Section 3.3
3. Check the Papyrus workspace files if you need to make edits (see `PAPYRUS_FILES_FOR_ALFONSO.md`)
4. Write the text descriptions for both sections
5. Add the diagrams to the Google Doc in the appropriate sections
